# WAF Tool

## Overview
The Web Application Firewall (WAF) Tool is designed to analyze incoming web traffic and detect potential SQL injection attempts. This tool acts as a middleware in a web application, inspecting requests for common SQL injection patterns and blocking malicious traffic.

## Features
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitors incoming requests for SQL injection signatures.
- **Middleware Integration**: Easily integrates with existing web applications.
- **Customizable**: Modify detection patterns as needed to suit specific application requirements.

## Installation
To install the WAF Tool, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd waf-tool
npm install
```

## Usage
To use the WAF Tool, include the middleware in your application. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set it up in your `app.ts` file:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { wafMiddleware } from './middleware/waf';

const app = express();

// Apply WAF middleware
app.use(wafMiddleware);

// Define your routes here

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
